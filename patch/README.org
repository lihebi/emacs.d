# Patches

* fic-mode
patch ~ox-html.el~ file in ~elpa/org-contrib~

this is buggy even if I disabled it...
see here file:///Users/hebi/github/wiki-new/js.html
basically when it is enabled, the exporting from org to html with htmlize to fontify the code will add three strange characters in the end of each line.
it turns out that the fic-mode is the culprit
to fix this, in ox-html.el file, add

#+begin_src elisp
(when (require 'fill-column-indicator nil 'noerror)
  (fci-mode -1))
#+end_src

after line ~(funcall lang-mode)~ in defun org-html-fontify-code
that should be around line 2048 ..
remove the ox-html.elc to make it in effect!
